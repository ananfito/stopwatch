## About
A simple stopwatch built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was built as part of the [JavaScript DOM Manipulation â€“ Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys) taught by CodeLab and hosted by freeCodeCamp. This project was created as part of my participation in the [#100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://github.com/ananfito/100-days-of-code).
